# Pomodoro Timer

The pomodoro timer technique is where you work for some amount of time (usually 25 minutes), and then you take a 5 minute break, and then you repeat.  It keeps you focused on task during the work interval, and then you have the break time to do anything you want.  

For some reason the symbol of the pomodoro is a tomato.  I personally hate tomatos so I swapped in a superior fruit for my timer.
